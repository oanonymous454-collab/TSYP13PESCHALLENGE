## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Load plant generation and weather data
- Display dataset shape and information
- Identify data types and structure
- Check for missing values and duplicates

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Remove PLANT_ID column (constant value)
- Identify and handle missing values in hourly aggregated data
- Remove duplicate rows (0 found in raw data)
- Handle missing values in resampled data using time-based imputation

### 3. Outlier Detection (IQR Method)
- Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR for numerical columns
- Identify outliers beyond ±1.5×IQR bounds
- Result: No outliers detected in the dataset

### 4. Data Segmentation by Source
- Split data by SOURCE_KEY (22 inverters)
- Analyze row counts per source (ranging from 3,104 to 3,155 rows)
- Select source with maximum rows (3,155 rows) for further analysis
- All sources have no missing values

### 5. Feature Engineering
- **Time-based resampling:** Aggregate raw data to hourly frequency
  - From 68,778 15-minute readings to 816 hourly readings
  - Calculate mean values for numerical features
- **Missing value imputation:** 
  - Use mean for times closer to noon
  - Use minimum for times closer to midnight
  - Result: All 20 missing values imputed

### 6. Data Merging
- Merge hourly aggregated generation data with weather data
- Use inner join on DATE_TIME and timestamp columns
- Final merged dataset: 816 rows × 14 columns
- All merged data has no missing values

### 8. Feature Scaling
Applied two scaling approaches:
- **StandardScaler:** Z-score normalization (mean=0, std=1)
- **RobustScaler:** Robust to outliers using IQR-based scaling

### 9. Correlation Analysis

## Conclusions

### Original Model (Weather Features Only)
This project initially demonstrated a complete data science pipeline from raw data to predictive modeling. However, the XGBoost model with weather features alone achieved only poor test performance (R² = 0.09), despite reasonable training performance (R² = 0.74). This massive gap indicated **severe overfitting** - the model memorized training noise rather than learning generalizable patterns.

**Lesson Learned:** Weather features alone are insufficient for solar power prediction. Solar generation is primarily driven by the availability of sunlight, which depends strongly on time-of-day and seasonal patterns.

### Improved Model (WITH Temporal Features & Regularization) ✅ RECOMMENDED
After implementing temporal feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning with regularization, the model achieved:
- **Train R² = 0.8922 and Test R² = 0.8928** (nearly identical!)
- **Overfitting gap reduced by 100.1%** (from 0.6475 to -0.0005)
- **Cross-validation stability:** R² = 0.8736 ± 0.0139 across 5 folds
- **Practical accuracy:** ~738 W average prediction error on test data

**Key Insight:** Temporal patterns (especially hour of day) account for 72.9% of solar generation variance. Once the model could capture these patterns, it achieved excellent generalization.

### Why This Works
```
Original: Weather only → Weak correlation → Overfitting
Improved: Weather + Time → Strong patterns + Regularization → Perfect generalization
```

The residual analysis reveals that improved model predictions are well-distributed across the prediction range, indicating robust performance across different power generation levels.
