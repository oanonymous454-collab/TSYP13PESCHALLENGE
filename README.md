FEATURE IMPORTANCE 
================================================================================

Top Features in Improved Model:
  1. Hour of Day .......................... 52.6%
  2. Is Daylight .......................... 10.9%
  3. Day of Year .......................... 9.4%
  4. Temperature .......................... 9.2%
  5. Humidity ............................ 5.2%
  6. Temp × CloudCover ................... 5.0%
  7. Cloud Cover ......................... 4.0%
  8. Temp × Humidity ..................... 2.0%
  9. Precipitation ....................... 1.7%

Insight: Temporal patterns account for 72.9% of model decisions!

============================================================================================================================
USAGE
================================================================================

The updated README now serves as:
1. Complete documentation of both models (old with overfitting issue and new with almost no issue at overfitting to showcase the importance of th HOUR OF THE DAY Feature and why we work on such parameter for best performance)
2. Performance comparison and improvement metrics
3. Feature importance and model explainability
4. Roadmap for further improvements
5. Production-ready model certification

Users can now understand:
- Why the original model failed (overfitting)
- How the improved model fixed it (temporal features + regularization)
- What contributes to model decisions (feature importance)
- How reliable the model is (cross-validation)
- Next steps for improvement (prioritized recommendations)


================================================================================

To conclude this README.md highltights the importance of Hour of day as a feature and why we selected such topic to work on
so in future dates giving for this model and giving the weather features thanks to the used Weather API, it will be predicting  the production of the pv panel and gives us an idea about the gap
